# Execution Plan — [FEATURE_NAME]

**Generated on**: `[YYYY-MM-DD]`
**Planner**: `[PLANNER_NAME]`
**Feature Branch**: `[FEATURE_BRANCH]`
**Spec Path**: `[SPEC_FILE_PATH]`
**Part**: **[PART_INDEX] of [TOTAL_PARTS] — [PART_NAME]**

## Context *(mandatory)*

Implement **[HIGH_LEVEL_GOAL]**.

This scope should consider:

* **Target Project / Module**: `[TARGET_MODULE_OR_PACKAGE]`
* **Main Stack**: `[MAIN_STACK]`
* **Expected Architecture Pattern**: `[ARCHITECTURE_PATTERN]`
* **Relevant Technical Constraints**: `[TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINTS]`
* **Mandatory Helpers / Abstractions / Utilities**: `[MANDATORY_HELPERS_OR_ABSTRACTIONS]`

### Implementation Intent

The implementation should:

* follow the existing patterns in the repository
* reuse existing code and abstractions before introducing new solutions
* preserve compatibility with the current architecture
* maintain consistency with naming, folder structure, domain conventions, and implementation style already adopted in the project

## Final Considerations *(mandatory)*

<!--
    ACTION REQUIRED: Ensure the implementation adheres to the following guidelines.
    These are critical for maintaining code quality, consistency, and architectural integrity.
-->

* The implementation must strictly follow the existing standards in the repository.
* Do not introduce new abstractions if an equivalent pattern already exists in the project.
* Reuse helpers, services, validators, factories, callbacks, and conventions already adopted.
* Always respect transactional consistency when multiple entities are modified in the same operation.
* In destructive operations, explicitly state whether the expected behavior is soft delete, hard delete, logical unlinking, or external resource cleanup.
* Preserve data isolation, authorization rules, relational integrity, and compatibility with the current architecture.
* Update tests, technical documentation, and API contracts when applicable.
* In case of ambiguity, prioritize the existing pattern in the domain closest to this feature.
